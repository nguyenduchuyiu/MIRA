# MIRA - Multi-Modal Intelligent Response Assistant

## Overview
MIRA is an intelligent assistant designed to process real-time audio and visual inputs, understand natural language, and generate appropriate responses. It integrates advanced technologies for speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language understanding to provide a seamless user experience.

## Core Functionalities
- **Audio Input Capture**: 
  - Real-time audio capture and processing.
  - Speech-to-text conversion using Google Speech-to-Text or Mozilla DeepSpeech.
  - Continuous listening with wake word "Hey MIRA".
  - Handles multiple audio sources and noise reduction.

- **Visual Input Capture**:
  - Real-time video/image capture.
  - Object/face detection and optional OCR using Tesseract.
  - Handles multiple visual streams with OpenCV.

- **Data Processing**:
  - Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for audio inputs.
  - Computer vision models for visual data.
  - Contextual awareness in multi-turn conversations.
  - Error handling for ambiguous input.

- **Response Generation**:
  - Generate responses through speech (gTTS), text, or visual feedback.
  - Integrate with external APIs like GPT API for advanced reasoning.
  - Provide feedback on action success/failure.

## Architecture
MIRA is built with a modular architecture, consisting of the following modules:
- **Audio Processing Module**
- **Visual Processing Module**
- **Reasoning Engine Module**
- **Response Generation Module**
- **Database Module**

## Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Optional Languages**: C++ (for performance-critical components), JavaScript/HTML/CSS (for web-based UI)
- **Libraries**: 
  - SpeechRecognition, PyAudio, gTTS
  - OpenCV, Tesseract OCR
  - GPT API, spaCy/NLTK
  - SQLite, FastAPI/Flask
  - Tkinter or Electron.js
